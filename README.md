# Odin Shop

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, specifically from the [Shopping Cart lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart). It is a mock e-commerce site where users can browse and interact with a shopping cart, but no actual purchases can be made.

## Project Overview

Odin Shop is a simple e-commerce platform that showcases a collection of some of my favorite movies. The site allows users to:

- Browse a selection of movies.
- View detailed information about each movie.
- Add movies to a shopping cart (Can be only one copie of the movie or multiple).
- View and manage the contents of their cart.
- Proceed through a mock checkout process.

## Features

- **Movie Browsing**: Users can browse through a curated list of movies.
- **Movie Details**: Click on any movie to see more detailed information, including the director, cast, and a brief synopsis.
- **Shopping**: Users can add movies to their cart and adjust quantities and click to the movie poster or title to have access to movie detail.
- **Cart** Users can see all movies added to his cart, with the quantity requested for each movie. He can see the total price and can click for a mock checkout process.
